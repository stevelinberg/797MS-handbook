# TODO: Multiple Logistic Regression {#multiple-logistic-regression}

## TL;DR

What it does
: Models the *probability* that an observation falls into one of two categories, when using more than one predictor

When to do it
: When you have multiple possible predictors and aren't getting a high enough success rate in a simple logistic regression, and want to see if multiple predictors can improve the model

How to do it
: With the `glm()` function, specifying `family = "binomial"` and listing more than one predictor in the formula

How to assess it
: Same as for simple [logistic regression](#logistic-regression): Look for significant $p$-values for the predictors, and assess the fit's predictive accuracy against training data

## What it does

Functionally, multiple logistic regression is the same as simple logistic regression, with the addition of more predictor variables in the formula.

XXX in fact, we can probably do without this page.
