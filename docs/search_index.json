It contains a simple reference and breakdown for a couple of dozen core methods used in machine learning. The intent is twofold: Serve as a reference for the basics of the material covered in the class, using language and examples that are as simple as possible to explain the core concepts and how to do them; Force myself to learn these techniques better by carrying out the above.

When to do it When you want to see if pretty much the simplest possible model provides enough of an explanation of variance for your purposes How to do it With the lm() function, among other ways How to assess it Look for a significant \\(p\\)-value for the predictor, and a reasonable \\(R^2\\) 2.2 What it does Simple linear regression is where it all begins; among the simplest of all of the regression techniques in analysis, which attempts to estimate a slope and an intercept line for a set of observations using a single predictor variable \\(X\\) and an output variable \\(Y\\). It uses ordinary least squares (OLS) to build its model, looking for the line through the mean of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) that has the smallest sum of squares between the predicted and observed values. 2.3 When to do it It is a simple first step for looking at data to see if there is an easy single-variable model that does a reasonable job predicting outcomes using one predictor variable. Sometimes, it can be good enough! It has the advantage of being easy to execute, to understand and to communicate, and the value of these factors should not be underestimated. Communicating with non-specialists is an important aspect of a data scientist’s job. Linear regression requires a dataset with a continuous outcome variable; it is easiest and most effective if the predictor variable is also numeric, whether continuous or discrete. It is possible to do linear regression with non-numeric predictors, such as true/false or ordered responses, by converting the predictors to a numeric scale. 2.4 How to do it 2.5 How to interpret the output 2.6 Where to learn more "],["multiple-linear-regression.html", "Chapter 3 Multiple Linear Regression 3.1 TL;DR 3.2 What it does 3.3 When to do it 3.4 How to do it 3.5 How to interpret the output 3.6 Where to learn more", " Chapter 3 Multiple Linear Regression 3.1 TL;DR What it does Looks to see how well multiple predictor variables predict an outcome, like how well do years of education and age predict salary? When to do it When a simple linear regression doesn’t provide a good enough explanation of variance, and you want to see if adding additional variables provides a better one How to do it With the lm() function, utilizing more than one predictor How to assess it Look for significant \\(p\\)-values for the predictors, and a reasonable adjusted-\\(R^2\\) 3.2 What it does Multiple linear regression is the first natural extension of simple linear regression. It allows for more than one predictor variable to be specified. It is also possible to combine predictors in interactions, to find out if combinations of predictors have different effects than simply adding them to the model. XXX explain/demo 3.3 When to do it Use multiple linear regression when a simple linear regression doesn’t provide a good enough explanation of the variance you’re observing, and you want to see if adding more predictors provides a better fit. Typically, this would be in response to either a low \\(R^2\\) that leaves a lot of unexplained variance, or even just a visual conclusion drawn from seeing a plot of a linear model with an unsatisfactory regression line. 3.4 How to do it The lm() function, using more than one predictor in the formula. 3.5 How to interpret the output 3.6 Where to learn more
